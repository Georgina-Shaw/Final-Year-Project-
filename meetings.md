We agreed that Georgina will fit distributions to observed predator/prey
mass ratios for a wide range of species, using several data sets. Georgina
has already fitted distributions to Cod stomachs from Murray Thompsons's 
stomach data.

For her preliminary report she will look at different definitions of
predator/prey mass ratio, starting with a paper by Nakazawa et.al (2011).

We looked at Georgina's fits to Cod data. I ask Georgina to look more into
the way to estimate the parameters.
