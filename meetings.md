# Meeting log

## 24/11/21

We agreed that Georgina will fit distributions to observed predator/prey
mass ratios for a wide range of species, using several data sets. Georgina
has already fitted distributions to Cod stomachs from Murray Thompsons's 
stomach data.

For her preliminary report she will look at different definitions of
predator/prey mass ratio, starting with a paper by Nakazawa et.al (2011).

## 01/12/21

We looked at Georgina's fits to Cod data. I ask Georgina to look more into
the way to estimate the parameters.

## 25/01/22

We discuss her preliminary report in which she presents how three papers she
found classify different definitions of predator/prey mass ratios. I tell
her that she should try to make things more precise. I recommend that she
initially concentrate on making the material from the paper by Reum et.al.
more precise.

## 01/02/22

I suggest to Georgina to illustrate the definitions of r_bio and r_num in
the paper by Reum et.al. by applying them to a stomach data set.

## 08/02/22

Georgina showed me her RMarkdown document with plots of empirical PPMR
distributions both in terms of numbers and in terms of biomass. She still
needs to make the connection to the definitions in the paper by Reum et.al.

## 15/02/22

We discuss that it would be good to try to fit Gaussian mixture distributions
to the log predator/prey mass ratios. Georgina will research how to do that
and then do it and explain it to me. Initially she will select the number of
components by eye and only play with automatic methods if time permits. 

Also if time permits she could investigate how to take other variables like
location or year into account (possibly as a mixed effects model).
